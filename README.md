## Key Algorithms

### Balance Calculation
The website calculates balances by:
1. Adding what each person paid
2. Subtracting their share of expenses they're involved in
3. Displaying the net balance for each person

### Settlement Optimization
The settlement algorithm:
1. Sorts people by balance (positive to negative)
2. Matches people who owe money with those who are owed money
3. Calculates the minimum amount needed to settle
4. Suggests optimal payment paths
